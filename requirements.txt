#
# Minimal Python dependencies for tANN-viscoplasticity_solver
# (training, evaluation, HDF5 extraction, visualization, DAMASK input export)
#

numpy>=1.23
matplotlib>=3.7
h5py>=3.8
PyYAML>=6.0

# ML
torch>=2.1

# Video/IO
imageio>=2.31
imageio-ffmpeg>=0.4.9

# Optional-but-used in some analysis scripts (has fallback if missing)
scipy>=1.10

# Optional (only needed if you want to run `export_geom.py` via DAMASK's Python API).
# NOTE: On Windows + very new Python versions, DAMASK's dependency `vtk` may not have wheels.
# If you hit install issues, skip DAMASK and still run training/eval fine.
# damask>=3.0
